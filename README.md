# CTF-Writeups
A repo for storing writeups of CTF challenges solved by members of the ASU Hacking Club

Writeups are organized first by CTF where folders are named with {CTFname}{YYYY} then by category, and finally a folder with the challenge title containing any related solve scripts and materials with an accompanying WRITEUP.md file.
